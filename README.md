## Proposal

<strong> Final 30 Proposal </strong>

 <b> Create and submit a PROPOSAL for your project that includes: </b>

<em> A clear and articulate description of your project idea </em>
* Take chess notation and convert coordinates into music
* Separate black and white moves
* Use chess files as a chord (starts at a point, ex. [A4])
* Use chess ranks as a chord (starts at a point, ex. [C4])
* Use Sonic Pi functions to make coding easier and more efficent
* Use arrays to sort chess notation from start to finish
* Use special moves like <i> castling </i> as special combination of chords
* Make it sound good


<em> Why you are motivated to do this project </em>
* Combines the arts of code and music into one project.
* More specifically, it allows for the arts of chess to be transformed into the arts of music and code.

<em> How you will incorporate your learnings from this course into the project </em>
* Basic coding
* Art of design
* Planning
* Thinking 
* Possible music theory

<em> A list of milestones </em>
* Use coordinates and commit them to specific keys / notes
* Use special moves like castling as special key inputs / chords
* Able to program a chess opening into a list of notes / chords
* Design an efficient way to import code into Sonic Pi
* Make the music sound good
